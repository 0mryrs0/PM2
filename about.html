        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHaving access to quality education is crucial for both individuals and societies as it can bring about better job prospects and improve critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. However, inadequate funding, lack of qualified teachers, outdated teaching methods, and unequal access to educational resources are some of the reasons why quality education may be lacking. A quality education can also help reduce poverty, inequality, and social unrest by empowering individuals to participate fully in society. The idea behind EduKaTeach is to provide students a platform where they will get the required help from volunteer teachers who are willing to share their knowledge with the students. The aim is to provide them an alternative method, to use technology to make teaching more accessible to those who need it. This is the most effective approach to reconnect with the people, not just the knowledge but also to the people who want to learn on this platform. The issues that can affect the end of the Edukateach how the platform recognizes the people and helps them to task promptly.</p>
